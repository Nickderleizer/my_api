 Backup Schemes

In this assignment, I explored three common backup schemes and described how each works, with its pros and cons.
1. Full Backup
Description: This type of backup copies all files and data in the system or specified directory every time it runs.

How it's executed: Run a command to copy everything into a backup file. Example with tar:

bash
Copy

tar -czf full_backup.tar.gz /var/www/your_api
Advantages:

Easy to restore, everything is in one place.

No need to combine multiple backups.

Disadvantages:

Takes a lot of time and storage.

Not efficient for frequent backups.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Incremental Backup
Description: Only backs up files that have changed since the last backup (full or incremental).

How it's executed: Use rsync or backup tools that track file changes (e.g., rsnapshot, tar with timestamps).

Advantages:

Very efficient in storage and speed.

Good for daily or frequent backups.

Disadvantages:

Restoring takes timeâ€”you need the last full backup and all incremental backups.

More complex recovery.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Differential Backup
Description: Backs up files changed since the last full backup.

How it's executed: Also done with tools like rsync, or manually identifying changed files.

Advantages:

Faster to restore than incremental backups.

Less storage than full backups.

Disadvantages:

Requires more space than incremental backups.

Grows in size each day until the next full backup.
